        <p class="muted">
          We do not require users to provide personal information such as names, addresses, or phone numbers to use TimeCam.
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          If you contact us directly (for example, via email for support), we may receive information such as your email address and

          <li>Images are not reviewed by humans.</li>
          <li>Images are not sold, shared, or published.</li>
          <li>Images are not used for advertising, profiling, or training proprietary AI models.</li>
          <li>Uploaded media may be temporarily processed by third-party AI services, including FAL.ai, strictly to generate the requested output.</li>
        </ul>

          Images containing face data may be transmitted to third-party AI service providers (such as FAL.ai) only for the purpose of
          processing the image request. These providers process data transiently and are contractually prohibited from using it for any
          other purpose.
